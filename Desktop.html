                    <td style="border: 2px solid black">Both C and C++ are considered high-performance languages due to their significantly low abstraction from the details of the computer system. As such, they are widely used in developing applications where performance is a critical issue, such as client/server applications, commercial products etc.<br>
                    As expected, due to a low abstraction, these languages are harder to learn (especially C). Many things that are handled automatically in other languages such as Python, you must take care of manually in these languages. For these reasons, I would avoid recommending any of these two languages to absolute beginners.</td>

                    <td style="border: 2px solid black">Java’s main benefits are it’s portability and security across so many devices and platforms. Java achieves with this with it’s use of Bytecode (intermediate code) and the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). I wrote an entire article specifically about Bytecode and the JVM, taking a detailed look at it’s inner workings and how it benefits Java so much. Due to these reasons Java is also known as W.O.R.A or Write Once Run Anywhere.<br>
                    While not directly related to Desktop development, learning Java will also give you the benefit of being able to create mobile apps easily. Java is after all, one of the most popular languages for mobile development. This way if you ever want to develop a mobile app equivalent of your desktop application, you can easily do so.</td>

                    <td style="border: 2px solid black">Python is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that does not need a programmer to write longer lines of code for executing the concept. It is one of the highly flexible languages that one can use. Not only that but Python has a vast range of GUI frameworks that allow developers to create an application in an easy and secure manner.<br>
                    Some of the frameworks that you can use to develop not only windows application but others too with Python, includes, PyQT (a combination of QT library and Python) that lets the developer decide whether to create visual dialogues using QT Designer or create a program using code; Kivy (an OpenGL ES2 framework) enables programmers to write code once and use it on different platforms; WxPython, PyGUI, and Tkinter.</td>

Despite it being well known as a scripting language for web pages, several non-browser environments also use it.<br>
                    JS is among the top programming languages for desktop app development. Using frameworks like Buildfire.js, Electron, NW.js, AppJS, Meteor, and Proton Natives, JS can help developers in designing and developing cross-platform desktop applications.</td>

It allows Ruby applications to be run within a Java Virtual Machine and interface with libraries written in either Java or Ruby. Although the JRuby project was initiated in 2001, interest in JRuby has grown significantly over the last few years, reflecting an overall growth in interest in Ruby sparked by the success of the Ruby on Rails framework. Sun has contributed to JRuby’s success by employing members of the core development team and providing support for JRuby in the NetBeans development environment, among other efforts.</td>
