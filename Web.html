            <h2>Front-End</h2>
            <p>The frontend of a website is what you see and interact with on your browser. Also referred to as “client-side”, it includes everything the user experiences directly: from text and colors to buttons, images, and navigation menus.<br><br>
            Let’s say you decide to start a business. You open a gourmet dog treat bakery and need a professional website to present your company to customers and tell them where you’re located. Maybe you’ll include a few photos and some information about your products. All you need are frontend technologies to build your website.</p>

                    HTML is used to create a starting point for the website and is what most of your static pages start from. A better way to understand this language is to consider it as the skeleton that is holding your website together.</td>

                    It definitely has to do with its role in front-end web development. Gmail, Twitter, YouTube, and other popular platforms use this language to dynamically display content and launch interactive web pages. Despite the fact that JavaScript is one of the frontend languagesfor  web development, you can use it on the server-side through Node.js.</td>

            <h2>Back-End</h2>
            <p>The backend (or “server-side”) is the portion of the website you don’t see. It’s responsible for storing and organizing data, and ensuring everything on the client-side actually works. The backend communicates with the front-end, sending and receiving information to be displayed as a web page. Whenever you fill out a contact form, type in a web address, or make a purchase (any user interaction on the client-side), your browser sends a request to the server-side, which returns information in the form of frontend code that the browser can interpret and display.<br><br>
            Your new site will need to have additional backend components to make it a dynamic web application — a website whose content can change based on what is in its database, and that can be modified by user input. This is distinct from a static website, which doesn’t require a database because its content generally stays the same.</p>

                    Also, Python is known as the best solution for machine learning and AI web applications. <br>To find out how it works just take a look at products from Nasa, Netflix, Microsoft, and other big players. Python has a wide variety of libraries and Flask, Pyramid, and Django frameworks grow in popularity.</td>

                    When processing code on the server-side, PHP ignores the browser's interpretation, which is extremely rare among programming languages used in web development. Accordingly, this tool obeys HTTP and stresses the queried web server more often.</td>

                    It is an object-oriented focus where every value and class is an object. At the same time, RoR is devoid of primitive data types that slow down the work. This tool is used by Basecamp, Hulu, Zendesk, and AirBnB.</td>
